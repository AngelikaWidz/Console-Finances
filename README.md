# Console-Finances

In this project, I worked on some data analysis in JavaScript using pseudocode and ten million Google searches and JS cheatsheets, especially since I am still relatively new to coding especially JavaScript.

I'm currently learning to become more independent in my problem-solving and familiarising myself more with the JavaScript syntax - getting more practice in after learning some theory behind JS.
